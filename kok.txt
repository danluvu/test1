Dear [Examination Authority],

I am writing to request a shift in my upcoming examination date due to my current health condition. Unfortunately, I have been experiencing some 
health issues which are making it difficult for me to prepare for the exam as well as to take it on the scheduled date.

I am aware that your institution has a policy regarding exam shifting, and I would like to request your kind consideration of my request.
 I have enclosed a copy of my medical examination results with this letter, which provides details of my health condition. I hope that this will provide the necessary information to support my request.

I understand the importance of adhering to academic schedules and maintaining academic standards, and I assure you that I am not making this request lightly. 
I am committed to writting this exam and want to perform to the best of my abilities. However, given my current health situation, I believe that it would 
be more appropriate for me to take the exam on a later date when I am in a better position to do so.

I would be very grateful if you could consider my request and let me know if there is any further information or documentation that you require. Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
